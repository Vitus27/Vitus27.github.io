            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p><b>LSPDFR Enhanced</b> is an advanced extension for the LSPDFR modification, designed to add a significant dose of <b>realism</b> to your gameplay and provide you with a sense of purpose. In the default LSPDFR, there’s no <b>progression</b> system — no ranks or career advancements. LSPDFR Enhanced <b>changes this entirely</b>, allowing you to earn points for completing callouts and climb the ranks within agencies like the LSPD, LSSD, or SAHP (or any other, as the rank system is fully customizable).</p>
            
            <p>The plugin introduces shift schedules and locations, along with realistic mechanics for you to manage hunger, fatigue, fuel, and apartment payments. And that’s just the beginning of its features.</p>

                <p>When starting a new career, you’ll receive information about the <b>time</b> and <b>location</b> of the police station where your <b>shift</b> begins. To start your shift, head to the designated station and <b>press T</b> before your shift starts. If you’re unsure where the station is located, look for the <b>light blue suitcase</b> icon on the map. Being late or missing a shift will result in <b>experience point deductions</b> (details below).</p>

				 <p>You can also start your shift early – the game will automatically skip ahead to the appropriate time.</p>

				 <p>Once your shift begins, gameplay remains similar to the standard LSPDFR experience: accept callouts, chase suspects, and conduct traffic stops. However, LSPDFR Enhanced introduces key changes:
				
				<ul>
				<li><b>Patrol Districts:</b> You’ll be assigned specific districts to patrol at the start of your shift. Leaving your assigned area will display a <b>warning icon (!)</b> in the top-left corner. However, during pursuits or callouts, you can travel <b>anywhere</b>.</li>
				<li><b>Authorized Vehicles:</b> You are limited to <b>specific police vehicles</b>. If you enter an unauthorized vehicle, you’ll see a <b>warning</b> and won’t be able to drive it. Visit any police garage and <b>press T</b> to view all authorized vehicles.</li>
				<li><b>Break Time:</b> During your shift, you can take a <b>30-minute break</b>. During this time, you won’t receive callouts and can freely move around the map. To do this, just press the <b>Left Control and "U"</b> key at any time.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Each shift lasts <b>12 hours</b> – from 12:00 PM to 12:00 AM or 12:00 AM to 12:00 PM. When your shift ends, return to the station where you started and press T again.</p>
				

				 <p>An additional feature is <b>the overtime</b> system. Up to three times per month, you can extend your shift to 14 hours by <b>pressing T and left CTRL simultaneously</b> at the start. Overtime comes with <b>increased earnings</b>.</p>

                <p>During your shift, earn experience points by handling callouts, arresting suspects, and conducting traffic stops. These points are added to your account after the shift ends. Each rank has a specific experience point range (e.g., 0–500). Advancing to a higher rank grants you increased pay, access to new police stations (and patrol areas), and unlocks new emergency vehicles.</p>

                <p>To keep your character alive, you need to manage their <b>hunger</b> and <b>fatigue</b> levels.</p>
				<p><b>Hunger:</b></p>
				<p>When your character is hungry, the screen starts <b>shaking</b>. Over time, they lose the <b>ability to run</b>, <b>walk as if injured</b>, and eventually <b>die</b>. The first hunger effects appear after approximately <b>35</b> in-game hours without food, with death occurring after <b>70</b> hours.</p>
				<p>To satisfy hunger, you have several options:
				<ul>
				<li><b>Store:</b> The cheapest option, but only restores <b>70%</b> hunger.</li>
				<li><b>Fast Food:</b> More expensive but restores <b>85%</b> hunger.</li>
				<li><b>Restaurant:</b> The most expensive option, fully restoring <b>100%</b> hunger.</li></p>
				</ul>
				<p>Meal prices depend on your hunger level – the hungrier you are, the more you’ll pay.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, you can <b>cook at home</b>. Buying ingredients and preparing a meal in your apartment is cheaper than dining out and also restores <b>100%</b> hunger. Here's how:
				<ol>
				<li>Visit a store, approach the fridge/freezer, press "E", and select the items you want to buy.</li>
				<li>Go to your apartment, approach the fridge, and press "E" to store the items.</li>
				<li>Approach the stove, press "E", and choose the dish you want to cook.</li></p>
				</ol>
				<p><b>Fatigue:</b></p>
				<p>When your character is tired, the screen shows <b>various effects</b>. Over time, the character begins to <b>fall randomly</b> and eventually <b>dies</b>. Fatigue effects start appearing after <b>27</b> in-game hours, with death occurring after <b>54</b> hours without sleep.</p>
				<p>To combat fatigue, you can: 
				<ul>
				<li><b>Sleep in your apartment bed:</b> Approach the bed, press "E", and select how many hours you want to sleep. The longer the sleep, the more fatigue is reduced. Sleep is <b>free</b> and restores up to <b>100%</b> energy.</li>
				<li><b>Drink coffee:</b> Available in cafes, this option restores up to <b>75%</b> fatigue but comes at a <b>cost</b>.</li>

                <p>From now on, your vehicle will <b>consume fuel</b> as you drive. When the fuel level gets critically low, your vehicle will start to skid and stall until it eventually comes to a complete stop.</p>
				<p><b>How to Refuel?</b></p>
				<p>You can refuel at any <b>fuel pump</b> on the map. There’s no need to limit yourself to marked gas stations – unmarked fuel pumps can also be used.</p>
				<p>To refuel:
				<ol>
				<li>Drive your vehicle to the <b>pump.</b></li>
				<li>Exit the vehicle, approach the pump, and press T.</li>
				<li>Move to the <b>rear left side</b> of the vehicle and press T again to start <b>refueling.</b></li>
				<li>To stop refueling, press T once more, then return to the pump and press T again.</li></p>
				</ol>
				<p>Refueling costs <b>money</b>, but it’s <b>free</b> for <b>police</b> vehicles if you’re on duty. You need to refuel only <b>cars</b> and <b>motorcycles</b>.</p>

                <p>With the new <b>time scaling system</b>, you can now adjust in the settings how many real-life milliseconds correspond to one in-game second. This allows you to extend gameplay time and tailor the pace to your preferences.</p>

                <h2>ranks.xml file</h2>
                <p>To configure the <b>“ranks.xml”</b> file for the rank system in LSPDFR Enhanced, follow the structure below. This system allows you to assign specific ranks to your character based on points earned, determine assigned stations and patrol zones, and set salaries and vehicles for each rank.</p>
                <p>File Structure:</p>
                <p><b>Ranks:</b> The root element containing all rank configurations. Each rank is enclosed in <i>&lt;Rank&gt;</i> tags.</p>
                <p><b>Rank:</b> Each rank includes a set of attributes defining its name, required points, assigned stations, zones, salary, and vehicles.</p>
                <p>Inside each <i>&lt;Rank&gt;</i> tag:
				<ul>
				<li><b>&lt;Name&gt;:</b> The name of the rank (e.g., Officer I, Sergeant I).</li>
				<li><b>&lt;PointsMin&gt; and &lt;PointsMax&gt;:</b> The minimum and maximum points needed to achieve or maintain this rank. For example: <i>&lt;PointsMin&gt;0&lt;/PointsMin&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;PointsMax&gt;500&lt;/PointsMax&gt;</i> mean that to be an Officer I, the player needs between 0 and 500 points.</li>
				<li><b>&lt;Stations&gt;:</b> Defines the police stations where this rank can work. Each station is enclosed within a <i>&lt;Station&gt;</i> tag.</li>
				<ul>
				<li><b>&lt;StationName&gt;:</b> The name of the assigned station (e.g., La Mesa Police Station).</li>
				<li><b>&lt;Zones&gt;:</b> Defines the patrol zones for each station. You can list several zones inside <i>&lt;Zone&gt;</i> tags (e.g., LMESA, EBURO).</li>
				</ul>
				<li><b>&lt;Salary&gt;:</b> The salary paid to the player per in-game day at this rank (e.g., 385 for Officer I).</li>
				<li><b>&lt;Vehicles&gt;:</b> Defines the police vehicles available for this rank. Each vehicle is listed in a <i>&lt;Vehicle&gt;</i> tag with two attributes:</li>
				<ul>
				<li><b>model:</b> The vehicle model name (e.g., “police” or “police3”).</li>
				<li><b>Vehicle:</b> The display name for the vehicle (e.g., “Police Cruiser”).</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>
				<p>Customizing Ranks:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>To Add New Ranks:</b> Copy the structure of an existing <i>&lt;Rank&gt;</i> block, change the <i>&lt;Name&gt;</i>, and adjust points, stations, zones, salary, and vehicles accordingly.</li>
					<li><b>To Add/Modify Patrol Zones:</b> Inside each <i>&lt;Station&gt;</i>, list multiple zones in <i>&lt;Zone&gt;</i> tags. These correspond to in-game areas the player can patrol while at that rank.</li>
					<li><b>To Adjust Salary:</b> Modify the <i>&lt;Salary&gt;</i> value to change the daily in-game pay for that rank.</li>
					<li><b>To Add New Vehicles:</b> Add more <i>&lt;Vehicle&gt;</i> tags with different models and names to provide the rank access to a wider variety of vehicles.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Final Notes:</p>
				<p>This configuration allows you to control the player's career progression, assigned stations, patrol zones, and available vehicles for each rank.
After making changes to the ranks.xml file, ensure you reload the entire LSPDFR plugin for the updates to take effect.</p>
